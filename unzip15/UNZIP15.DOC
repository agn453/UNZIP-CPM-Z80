UNZIP dissolves MS-DOS ZIP files.  This version incorporates some 
quick and dirty mods to make a more useful utility.  The original 
by David Goodenough has to be the most God-awful source code I've 
ever come across.  It was totally uncommented, and I have no idea 
what kind of strange assembler it was written for.  This code now 
assembles with SLR's Z80ASM and it's a little more orderly.

USAGE:

     UNZIP {dir:}zipfile {dir:}

Under ZCPR3 "dir" can be a DU or DIR spec.  Under vanilla CP/M 
only a drive is recognized.

If a destination drive is given, member files are extracted to 
it.  With no destination given, member files are merely checked 
and listed to the screen...slowly.

You can now abort this thing with ^C (and the partial output 
file, if any, will be closed and erased).  The usage screen now 
responds to "//".

UNZIP still needs a lot of work.  It really ought to be possible 
to extract member files selectively, but it's all or nothing at 
present.  In addition, listing files should be a lot faster; 
checking CRC's in that mode seems unnecessary.  Typing a member 
file to the screen would also be a nice enhancement.  I have only 
limited use for an UNZIP utility, so my purpose here was to do 
just enough to make its operation acceptable.  Maybe someone else 
will interested in going further.  In the meantime, Steve 
Greenberg's ZIPDIR and Carson Wilson's ZTYPE can fill the gap.

This version is probably not bullet-proof.  Testing has been very 
limited, and frankly I don't understand much of the code, but so 
far it seems to work.

Version 1.4 modifications by Bruce Morgen, 5/16/91

In addition to fixing a bug in the ZCPR3 detection code at 
"setusr," Version 1.4 adds output filename specification with 
wildcards.  Now the use of an output d:/dir: and/or an output 
filename will trigger extract mode.  If the output filespec 
contains no wildcards (a d:/dir: alone is equivalent to "*.*"), 
UNZIP will now exit after the first extraction (made sense to me, 
any objections?).  And no, Gene, I am NOT "adopting" UNZIP -- I 
just tweaked it far enough that it ceased to annoy me 
significantly in the very limited use I have for it...

Version 1.5 modifications by Howard Goldstein, 6/1/91

This release contains no new features or options.  Its purpose is
merely to correct some serious bugs that were introduced in the
previous version.  See the source file for details.

Like Bruce and Gene, I have no intention of doing any further
develompment on this program.  I will, however, attempt to fix
anything that does not work as documented.
