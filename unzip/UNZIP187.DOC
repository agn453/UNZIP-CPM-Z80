                           Version 1.8-7

This version of UNZIP now can extract all files from MS-DOS ZIP files.  The 
addition of the UnDeflate decompression method make this possible since 
previous versions could not handle Deflated files.  Additionally it sets 
the date stamp of the extracted file is the OS supports date stamping.

Usage Syntax:

         UNZIP {dir:}zipfile {dir:}{afn}

Under ZCPR3 "dir" can be a DU or DIR spec; otherwise, just a drive.  If no 
destination drive is given, member files are checked and listed that match 
"AFN".  If a destination drive is given, member files are extracted that match 
"afn" if given, otherwise all member files are extracted.  This follows the 
syntax used by for example UNARC.

You can abort UNZIP at any time with ^C (and the partial output file, if 
any, will be closed and erased).  

Help on useage is available by entering "//".  This program still needs a 
lot of work.  It's probably not bullet-proof and testing has been very 
limited, but it seems to work.

For each file processed, UNZIP prints out all the file information 
contained in the zip file. The following is an example.

Production:

Either Microsoft compatible or SLR compatible libraries can be used.  Set 
the conditional SLRLIBS to FALSE to use to Microsoft compatible libraries 
SYSLIB, ZSLIB DSLIB and Z3LIB, move these libraries to the default 
directory.
   Assemble with ZMAC, Z80ASM or M80:
     ZMAC UNZIP187, Z80ASM UNZIP187/M or M80 =UNZIP187
   Link with ZML, SLRNK or LINK.  For ZML simply type
     zml unzip187
Linking with SLRNK or LINK is more complicated.  For SLRNK, first make a 
trial link:
     SRLNK /A:2000,UNZIP187/P:100,UNZIP187/N/E
take the number in parens in the output, add 100h to it and replace the 
2000 above with the result and make a final link.
For LINK do the following
     LINK UNZIP187
Note the CODE SIZE displayed in screen output, add 100h to it and denote 
result as N.  LINK includes unitialized data in the COM file producing a 48k 
output.  To reduce COM file size, use the CP/M Plus version of SID as 
follows:
     SID UNZIP187.COM
     WUNZIP187,100,N
     G0
Have been unable to get L80 to link.

To use SLR compatible libraries SYSLIBS, ZSLIBS and Z3LIBS, copy these 
libraries to the default directory and set the conditional assembly equate 
'SLRlibs' true. Then assemble with Z80ASM
     Z80ASM UNZIP187/R
In this case, SLRNK is the only linking option.  Use the two step linking 
process described above to produce a COM file.

Revision History:

Version 1.2 -- July 3, 1990 -- David P. Goodenough

Version 1.3 -- Gene Pizzetta - May 12, 1991

UNZIP dissolves MS-DOS ZIP files.  This version incorporates some quick and 
dirty mods to make a more useful utility.  The original by David Goodenough 
has to be the most God-awful source code I've ever come across.  It was 
totally uncommented, and I have no idea what kind of strange assembler it 
was written for.  This code now assembles with SLR's Z80ASM and it's a 
little more orderly.

You can now abort this thing with ^C (and the partial output file, if any, 
will be closed and erased).  The usage screen now responds to "//".

UNZIP still needs a lot of work.  It really ought to be possible to extract 
member files selectively, but it's all or nothing at present.  In addition, 
listing files should be a lot faster checking CRC's in that mode seems 
unnecessary.  Typing a member file to the screen would also be a nice 
enhancement.  I have only limited use for an UNZIP utility, so my purpose 
here was to do just enough to make its operation acceptable.  Maybe 
someone else will interested in going further.  In the meantime, Steve 
Greenberg's ZIPDIR and Carson Wilson's ZTYPE can fill the gap.

This version is probably not bullet-proof.  Testing has been very limited, 
and frankly I don't understand much of the code, but so far it seems to work.

Version 1.4 modifications by Bruce Morgen, 5/16/91

In addition to fixing a bug in the ZCPR3 detection code at "setusr," Version 
1.4 adds output filename specification with wildcards.  Now the use of an 
output d:/dir: and/or an output filename will trigger extract mode.  If the 
output filespec contains no wildcards (a d:/dir: alone is equivalent to 
"*.*"), UNZIP will now exit after the first extraction (made sense to me, any 
objections?).  And no, Gene, I am NOT "adopting" UNZIP -- I just tweaked 
it far enough that it ceased to annoy me significantly in the very limited 
use I have for it...

Version 1.5 modifications by Howard Goldstein, 6/1/91

This release contains no new features or options.  Its purpose is merely to 
correct some serious bugs that were introduced in the previous version.  
See the source file for details.

Like Bruce and Gene, I have no intention of doing any further 
develompment on this program.  I will, however, attempt to fix anything 
that does not work as documented.

Version 1.6 modifications by Howard Goldstein, 4/3/92

OK, I lied.

I began using UNZIP a bit more recently and found it to be much too slow. 
I therefore took Gene's suggestion and changed the program so it no longer 
expands a file and checks its CRC when that file is not being extracted.  I 
also replaceed the disk read and write routines.  The old ones could handle 
only 128 bytes at a time; the new ones, from ZSLIB, can handle much larger 
buffers.  This increases speeed and decreases wear and tear on the drives.


Version 1.7 modifications by Howard Goldstein, 4/8/92

This version corrects a couple of bugs that were noticed shortly after 
version 1.6 was released.  The program now works correctly on files 
containing long ZIP comments.  A typo in the usage screen was also fixed.

Version 1.8 modifications by Howard Goldstein, 4/16/92

Another bug fix, (the last, I hope).  In version 1.6 I managed to break the 
section of the program that expands "reduced" files.  Version 1.8 fixes it.

Version 1.8-1 -- June 17, 2020 -- Martin

As postied to USENET newsgroup comp.os.cpm, a flaws in both the un- 
implode and un-shrink routines was found to be causing CRC errors or 
program crashes were discovered.

For un-implode, the algorithm is essentially a translation of the PKZ101 
MS-DOS algorithm in C that has been hand optimized into Z80 assembly 
language.  However, the readtree() function was incorrectly returning a 
byte value in the A register, when the shift routine at label ui5 was 
expecting a 16-bit value in HL.

For unshrink, there is a race condition with handling the "KwKwK" case 
that was omitted from the routine.

Both updates are flagged with ;;v1.8-1 comments, and the version sign-on 
message now includes the revision.

Version 1.8-2 -- September 3, 2020 -- Martin and Lars

Bug fixes and some major and minor enhancements.

Now properly handles the extraction of zero-length files.  Will now skip to 
the next file header if the compression method is unknown.  Fixed readbits 
when a full word (16 bits) is read (in preparation for implementing the 
unDeflate algorithm.  Fixed mis-ordering of variables.  Code makes the 
assumption that "bitbuf" is the byte before "bleft".  Major enhancement is 
the implementation the UnDeflate algorithm (based on the work by Keir 
Fraser's HiTech-C code at 
  https://github.com/keirf/Amiga-Stuff/blob/master/inflate/degzip_portable.c
Had to reduce I/O Buffers to 2K each because available memory no longer 
supports 8K buffers.

Version 1.8-4 -- October 18, 2020 -- Russell Marks and Lars

Made slight optimisations to bit-readers, and added various comments.

Use self-modifying code with an unrolled end loop in rdbybits, and add a 
"rd1bit" macro, for about a 12% speed improvement on overall extraction 
time compared to version 1.5-3.  Improvement on overall extraction time of 
38% total compared to Version 1.8.  Add some basic comments to code/data 
based mostly on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)
format description.  More optimisations to improve the speed of the 
UnDeflate method added.  Calls to readbits when an eight or fewer bit 
value is passed optimised to a new rdbybits routine (about a 20% speed 
improvement).  Cosmetic change the "V" label to "urV" for assembly with 
zmac under Unix.  Now use a table-based CRC algorithm.  This increases 
code size by about 1Kbyte and boosts speed.

Version 1.8-5 -- November 17, 2020 -- Lars Nelson

Squashed a couple minor bugs and added application of stored date stamps to 
extracted file in systems that support date stamping.

Version 1.8-6 -- December 2, 2020 -- Lars Nelson

changed the output format to be more like UNARC.  Now shows compressed 
and uncompressed file size, PKZIP version #, Compression Method, 
modification date and time and 32 bit CRC.

Version 1.8-7 -- June 14, 2021 -- Lars Nelson
