                    UNZIPZ   vers 0.4
                    Z-System UNZIPPER

UNZIPZ can extract all files from any zip file created by PKZIP on MSDOS.  
As such it should prove useful on CP/M systems for extracting CP/M relevant 
files from zip archives found on BBSs or the Web since UNZIPZ preserves date 
stamps on CP/M systems with Date Stamping.

To use UNZIPZ use the following Syntax:

  UNZIPZ [dir:]ufn[.ZIP][dir:][afn ][/o]

On ZCPR3x systems {dir} can be either in named directory or DU (Drive 
Letter followed by User number) form otherwise, the DU form must be used. 
If {afn} is not given, *.* is assumed.  If no option is specified, UNZIPZ 
checks the CRCs of the files matching {dir:afn}.  The only option is E which 
causes the extraction of files matching {dir:afn} unless the file already 
exists.  In that case, the user is informed that it exists and the file is not 
extracted.  To extract such files, they must be erased and then extraction 
reattempted.

For each file processed, the following information is displayed: Name,         
Uncompressed Length, Stored Length, Compression Method, PKZIP Version, 
File Date and Time, 32 bit CRC and Status.  Status consists of CRC OK, CRC 
ERR or EXISTS.  Example ouput:

UNZIPZ  Version 0.4-1 - SC

ZIP archive  = H4:SOURCE.ZIP
Output Drive = H4:
Name         Length  Stored   Method   Ver  File Date & Time    CRC    STATUS
============ ======= =======  ======== ===  =========  =====  ======== =======
UDATZI  .Z80    3201    1320  Deflated  20  19 Oct 20  07:22  CC7E8454  CRC OK
UNZIP   .Z80   18464    5419  Deflated  20  19 Oct 20  21:16  45E711B1  CRC OK
UNZIP12 .Z80   17649    5042  Deflated  20  08 Jun 20  07:46  4C05E1AB  EXISTS
  
The current version is a significant revision of ver 0.2.  Main improvement 
is the addition of the undeflate algorithm (thanks Martin).  In addition the 
CRCs are only checked for extracted files which speeds things up 
considerably.  Speedups to the undeflate algorithm by Russell Marks have 
also been incorporated.  The ouput display has been improved substantialy 
and is similar to UNARCZ10.

Version 0.2 Notes by Simoen Cran.

The files in this archive are my Z-modified version of UNZIP 1.2.  They 
consist of three files in order to make sure that the unitialised data ends 
up at the end of all files linked.  Also, because the unitialised data file 
(UDATZI.Z80) needed to share some equates with the main program, all 
equates have been put in a separate .LIB file.

The original program is fast and dirty.  This Z-modified version gets rid of 
some of the dirty without sacrificing too much else.  Note however, it is 
only in embryonic stages... It has not developed to the point of UNARCZ10 
for example.

That said though, it does work, and well enough to find a niche out there.  
Its main advantage is speed when you wish to extract all the files in the 
archive.  You can now specify particular files to extract, but it isn't much 
quicker in that mode, as it still decodes each file in the archive and checks 
its CRC. That will change in a future version.

The display is now better, but it is very much in development mode!  The 
idea is to have it approximately mimic UNARCZ10.  It kind of does that now, 
but leaves out a lot of information... I'm working on it!
