Introduction
------------
ZIP archiving is probably the most common method of archiving files, and
one of the most common methods of file compression. CPMZip consists of
programs that allow you to create, extract and examine ZIP archives.

The supplied programs are ZIP, UNZIP and ZIPDIR. They perform the following
actions:

    ZIPDIR  - v1.50 - Lists the contents of a ZIP file
    UNZIP   - v1.56 - Extracts stored files from a ZIP file
    ZIP     - v1.00 - Creates ZIP file, storing files

Brief usage details
-------------------
   ZIPDIR <zipfile> [options]
   ?		Display the ZIPDIR command and usage information.

   UNZIP <zipfile> <exspec> [options]
   exspec	Directory into which files will be extracted.
   ?		Display the UNZIP command and usage information.
   O		Overwrite any existing files.
   Q		Quiet mode.

   ZIP <zipfile> <infiles> [options]
   infiles	Wildcarded specification of files to include.
   ?		Display the ZIP command and usage information.
   O		Overwrite any existing output file.
   Q		Quiet mode.

If a command is run without any parameters, the usage information is displayed.
Options are supplied in [square brackets].

ZIPDIR will pause every 23 lines and wait for a keypress. SPACE will display one
more line, CTRL-C will abort, any other key will display another 23 lines.

Examples
--------
   ZIPDIR CPMZIP.ZIP		- list the entries in CPMZIP.ZIP, with information
				  about each file. Any directories are stripped
				  from the filenames, entries that are directories
				  are listed suffixed with '/' and stored as "Dir.".

   UNZIP SAMPLES.ZIP		- lists the files in SAMPLES.ZIP. Note this is
				  different to the default on other platforms.
   UNZIP SAMPLES.ZIP A:		- extracts from SAMPLES.ZIP and writes them to
   				  drive A. Any existing files will not be
   				  overwritten. The filenames are listed as they
   				  are extracted.
   UNZIP SAMPLES.ZIP *.*	- extracts to the current drive.
   UNZIP SAMPLES.ZIP B:*.TXT	- extract to drive B: files that match *.TXT.
   UNZIP SAMPLES.ZIP A: [O]	- extracts from SAMPLES.ZIP and overwrites any
				  existing files.
   UNZIP SAMPLES.ZIP A: [OQ]	- extracts from SAMPLES.ZIP and overwrites any
				  existing files, and display no output.

   ZIP A:DEMO.ZIP B:*.TXT	- create the ZIP archive A:DEMO.ZIP with the
				  files that match B:*.TXT. The filenames are
				  listed as they are included.
   ZIP A:DEMO.ZIP B:*.TXT [Q]	- as above, but performed silently.
   ZIP A:DEMO.ZIP B:*.* [OQ]	- zip everything on drive B, overwriting any
				  pre-existing A:DEMO.ZIP file, acting silently.

Technical Details
-----------------
A ZIP file consists of a series of entries in the following format:

	local file header signature     4 bytes  "PK",&03,&04
	version needed to extract       2 bytes
	general purpose bit flag        2 bytes
	compression method              2 bytes
	last modification time          2 bytes  in MS-DOS format
	last modification date          2 bytes  in MS-DOS format
	crc-32                          4 bytes
	compressed size                 4 bytes
	uncompressed size               4 bytes
	filename length                 2 bytes
	extra field length              2 bytes
	filename                       (variable size)
	extra field                    (variable size)
	data                           (variable size)

CP/M does not support subdirectories, so on extracting files and path
is junked as though with the the InfoZip -j option. Filenames are
forced to upper case and truncated to 8.3 filenames.

CP/M does not support time/date stamps, so these are ignored. CPMZIP3
supports time/date stamps on CP/M systems with date support such as
ZSDOS and CP/M Plus.
