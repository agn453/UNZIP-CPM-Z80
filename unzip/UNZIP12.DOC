UNZIP
=====

A small, lean and mean CP/M unzipper. This only has two modes of operation:

A>UNZIP FOO

will check the CRC for all files in foo.zip, but it does not extract.

A>UNZIP FOO E

will extract all files from foo.zip - there is no selective extract. Note
that UNZIP assumes a .ZIP extension, and adds one if it is not present.

Source is provided, hack on it if you feel like it. Nice things to add would
be a selective extract, a list option that uses the compressed size (cs:)
field to seek through the file without having to read it all, and maybe a
print to screen or printer option. User number support wouldn't go too far
astray either.
