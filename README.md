# UNZIP-CPM-Z80
UNZIP for CP/M Z80
==================

This is UNZIP for CP/M in Zilog Z80 assembler.

The files have been extracted from the distribution archive
UNZIP15.LBR from the Public Domain software library originally
distributed on 1-Jun-1991 as Version 1.5.

It incorporates modifications by Howard Goldstein on 1-Jun-1991
plus those by Bruce Morgan on 16-May-1991 (Version 1.4) and Gene
Pizzetta on 12-May-1991 (version 1.3); and includes the original
Version 1.2 source-code by David Goodenough dated 3-Jul-1990.

Recently Martin posted two bug fixes to the unshrink and unimplode
routines in the comp.os.cpm USENET group that fix two long outstanding
bugs (Jun-2020).

I'll incorporate these fixes to produce a new version soon.
